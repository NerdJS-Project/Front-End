## About the Project

<p>Inspired by the language-learning app, Duolingo, Brain Breeze is a learning app available in multiple platforms from iOS and Android devices to web browsers in any OS where students will be able to learn bite-size lessons rather than the tradiitonal three hours a week of lecture in universities. For instructors, they will be able to create and publish classes, organize the class with modules, and create lessons with content with text, video links, or both. Instructors can also implement assessments/quizzes into the lesson aswell to test the student's knowledge on the content.</p>
